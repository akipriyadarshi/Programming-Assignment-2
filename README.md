# Programming-Assignment-2

In this assignment there are three questions related to scala language:-

1>Find the last element of List with its index value without using inbuilt methods to extract last element directly

2>Print the table of each element in a List

3>Implement Stack and Queue using Lists


I have done and tested the solutions using test cases as well. You can find the implementation in src/main directory and test cases in src/test directory...
